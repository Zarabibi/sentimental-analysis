            "About This Video:\n",
            "I made a water powered forge blower to blow air into a furnace. Getting running water to power a blower had been on my list for a while now and the weather had been wet enough to cause enough flow in the creek to try one. A significant part of the labour in doing an iron smelt comes from the operation of the air supply (unless natural draft is used). The current air supply method I use was a hand powered, centrifugal fan encased in a housing as seen in previous videos.\n",
            "\n",
            " I had a 2 ideas as to how to automate this with water power. The first method was to build a large, slow water wheel and run a rope belt around it linking it to the smaller, faster fan rotor to spin it. I tried this and it kept having issues due to the rope not spinning the blower effectively and also the fact that the water level changed and the wheel stopped moving. \n",
            "\n",
            "The second idea was to use a small diameter water wheel directly connected to the fan rotor with a water spout dropping the flow onto the wheel at a height. This turned out to be the simplest and most effective of the methods with rotor speeds between 6 and 8 revolutions a second being attained. The then encased the fan inside the existing blower housing and tested the blower on a furnace build in front of it. The blower did indeed work though not as powerfully as a hand powered one.\n",
            "\n",
            "With some adjustments, the blower may be improved so it becomes competitive with the hand powered method. The water powered method will go endlessly without human effort and does not wear out any rope as does the hand powered method. It's simple and reliable and I'll be doing more experiments with it in future. \n",

            "Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n",

Because he is (from his point of view) the most evolved animal on earth, the bear Grizzy feels it's only natural that the ranger's house becomes his territory as soon as its owner is away. No other animal dares to contest this \"bear's privilege\" except the most inoffensive, stupid and ridiculous mammal family that exists: the Lemmings - who also move into the house as soon as the ranger is gone. Grizzy and the Lemmings lead a merciless battle over the house in an atmosphere of total madness, where the two adversaries constantly try to outdo each other with nasty tricks!\n",

            "I smelted iron from iron bacteria and then cast the iron in a mold to form a rudimentary knife, making this the first iron tool I've produced yet. The ore was a species of bacteria that lives by oxidizing iron dissolved in ground water. It appears as an orange/yellow cloudy precipitate in creeks and ponds. It's a very common natural occurrence and can be found on all continents. I collected the diluted ore and poured it into a large, porous ceramic pot I made. The water leaked out, leaving behind the concentrated iron bacteria \"mud\" like substance. I dried it out until it resembled rusty earth. It took a month to collect the ore for one 2 hour smelt, from a stretch of creek about 20 meters long. \n",
            "\n",
            "Charcoal was then made simply by burning a pile of wood in a small pit and then extinguishing it with just enough water once it had visibly carbonized. It was quicker to make than the charcoal I normally make in a mound (1hr vs 2.5hrs) and took less preparation time making than the mound from mud. A small furnace was made and the multiblade blower (made in the last episode) was attached to it for air supply. \n",
            "\n",
            "The furnace was preheated for an hour with wood and filled with charcoal at the end, using the blower periodically but not full blast. Then over the next hour, 3 double handfuls of charcoal (about 500g) and 2 single handfuls or ore (about 200g) were added every 5 minutes while blowing air into the furnace to burn it at this rate. Then there was a 30 min burn down still using the blower till the charcoal reached the level of the air entry. The total operation took 2 hrs. A lump of slag was taken from the furnace and broken up. Iron prills up to about 1 cm in diameter were retrieved. For the sake of experiment I weighed the iron produced on modern scales= 40g iron from an estimated 1.2 kg of ore. Even though this is a low yield by modern standards it is a marked improvement over my previous smelts that produced much smaller and fewer prills over all. I did another smelt that almost exactly reproduced this result (80g of iron stored). The increase in efficiency is due to the much better blower design (8 blades vs the original 4). \n",
            "\n",
            "Next I cast the iron in a mold. The melting point of pure metalic iron is 1538 C. However, the iron prills I produced are cast iron, an alloy of iron and carbon where carbon is about 2-4% by weight. Cast iron has a relatively tepid melting point of 1150 C. Such a temperature is easily attainable in an open hearth with charcoal and a forced air supply. So, I put the prills into a triangular clay mold and put it into a simple pit forge that took very little time to make. Importantly, I made a special flat air pipe that spread the incoming air into a sheet that blew over the width of the mold to heat all of it evenly, a round one would only heat the middle of the mold and not melt it completely. Charcoal was then put on top of the mold about 12.5 cm deep and the air blast started. The fire became white hot, exceeding the 1150 C needed to melt the iron. The iron melted filling the mold and the iron triangle was taken from it. \n",
            "\n",
            "Initially, I was going to make it into an axe head, but decided it was too brittle (cast iron is actually harder than pure iron but brittle) so I sharpened it into a knife. It took many hours of sharpening to bring the end to a point. It's not a sharp blade it works well for drilling holes in timber (like for making fire drill sockets). This represents the first iron tool I've made completely from scratch in the wild. Future experiments will focus on obtaining greater yields of iron, exploiting richer sources of ore and ultimately making better iron tools.\n",

            "About This Video:\n",
            "I tested a charcoal retort based on the Hookway retort method using only primitive materials. A normal retort is one in which the sealed chamber of wood is inside a furnace and the heat drives off the volatiles converting it to charcoal. The Hookway retort, invented by James Hookway (see original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBYaP5K0AkE ) has furnace, a metal pipe, inside the sealed chamber of wood, so the heat conducts out into the wood converting it to charcoal. In addition to this, escaping volatiles from the wood enter the pipe where they are burnt, adding further heat. After a while, no more wood is added to the furnace as it runs entirely of wood gas.\n",
            "\n",
            "In my version I made a clay pipe and tested it. It did produce some charcoal but most of the wood remained unburnt. This was due to the poor heat conductivity of the clay pipe relative to the metal pipe of the original. The charcoal it did produce from wood touching the clay pipe directly, was of excellent quality. Another benefit of the design was it did not need sealing of the air entries like a typical charcoal mount. The retort did not become self sustaining on woodgas and needed to be fed with wood for the duration of the burn.\n",
            "\n",
            "In future I'd try making charcoal in a large clay pot retort inside a furnace. I've done it in a previous video with a 25 cm diameter x 25 cm tall pot and it worked well producing shiny intact charcoal with the only unburnt wood at the bottom of the pot. For a new version I'd make the pot taller but not wider for greater yields. Or I'd simply make charcoal in a pit doused with water which gives poorer quality charcoal but with less time and effort. I've tested doused charcoal before in iron smelting and it seems to give the same yield of iron.\n",

            "Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n",

            "I tested a fly wheel on the blower. Taking an old clay fly wheel from the pump drill I made many years ago, I attached it to the axle of the one way spinning blower to see how it would effect performance. The fly wheel tends to smooth out the speed of the fan and maintaining high speed despite taking longer to get up to speed initially. A smelt was conducted using the new set up and the result was less iron than usual due to the rotor coming out of the bearings at times. To fix this, the thrust bearings were replaced with journal bearings by carving holes all the way through the wooden stakes as opposed to only part way through. The new set up is more stable and has no chance of coming out during use.\n",
            "Then, before the new set up could be tested, the monsoon season began and it rained nonstop for a week such that the hut had rain blowing in from its open sides making it impossible to make fire. A third wall was added to the hut made from fired bricks and clay mortar. A damaged section of roof was repaired with tiles salvaged from the old hut. Then I build a small water wheel that rolled up stream on wooden tracks to make use of the water. Looking forward I will probably do some water powered projects until the wet season eases.\n",

            "Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

Order yourself a LARQ Bottle PureVis 2 to go plastic free and enjoy ice cold water throughout the entire day. https://bylarq.com/undecidedpv2 Solar panels are typically made with silicon as their semiconducting material. Cadmium telluride based photovoltaics (or CdTe for short) are the second-most common kind of panels after silicon PV, but when silicon still makes up the vast majority of the market, that doesn‚Äôt mean as much. So what on earth are cadmium telluride solar panels? And if they‚Äôre already in use today, why are they the solar panel industry‚Äôs best-kept secret?\n",

            "About This Video:\n",
            "I took the iron I already smelted and re- smelted it. The iron was old and rusty from forging experiments. Iron oxidises faster when in the forge due to the hot and oxidising conditions. So I tried smelting it again to turn the rust back into iron. \n",
            "\n",
            "The first attempt involved charging the iron into a furnace in a single charge. The results were mixed, the iron was in separated pieces though the iron was softer and could be slightly cold forged. \n",
            "\n",
            "Next the iron was included in an iron smelt with fresh, roasted ore. 3 charges of ore were charged, then the scrap iron and then another 3 charges of ore. The result was cleaner but the iron was still in separate pieces.\n",
            "\n",
            " Next, an attempt was made to consolidate the iron in a forge. Bricks were taken off the furnace to reduce its height, to form a forge. The iron was charged into the forge and heated in front of the blast to consolidate it. The iron came together a bit but was still in separate bits. The iron was softer and more malleable though.\n",
            "\n",
            " Finally, the iron was put in a crucible with iron ore to decarburise it further. The iron was heated and it became absorbed into the slag. Nearly all of the iron was lost as oxide.\n",
            "\n",
            "I learnt some things from this project. One of the difficulties was not having the iron in one piece as the small pieces of iron tends to get lost in the coals. Next time, I'll likely try a crucible (without iron oxide in it) just to consolidate the freshly made cast iron prills. Once the iron is in one piece, I'll attempt to decarburise it and forge it with light hammer blows.\n",
            "\n",
            "About Primitive Technology:\n",
            "Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials. To find specific videos, visit my playlist tab for building videos focused on pyrotechnology, shelter, weapons, food & agriculture, tools & machines, and weaving & fiber.\n",

            "They look like futuristic spacecraft straight out of a science fiction movie: jets equipped with cutting-edge stealth technology. Their revolutionary design renders these stealth aircraft nearly invisible to enemy radar systems, giving them a significant advantage in military operations. But it's not just in the skies where this technology is making an impact. Advanced warships, such as the USS Zumwalt, also employ similar principles. Their unconventional, angular shapes combined with specialized coatings scatter enemy radar waves, making them extremely difficult to detect.\n",
            "\n",
            "But what does the future hold for stealth technology? Could it evolve to the point where it not only evades electronic detection but also deceives the human eye? Is it possible for this innovation to progress so far that it renders objects entirely invisible? These are the questions driving scientists and engineers worldwide as they push the boundaries of concealment technology, seeking the next breakthroughs that could redefine the limits of invisibility.\n",
